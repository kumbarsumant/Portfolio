        Hey there! I'm Sumant Kumbar, an enthusiastic software developer with
        two years of experience. I love crafting dynamic and visually appealing
        user interfaces that make web experiences smooth and enjoyable. With a
        solid foundation in problem-solving and a knack for innovative design, I
        bring a unique blend of creativity and technical expertise to my
        projects.

        I have a particular fondness for working with web technologies, but my
        curiosity and passion for learning keep me exploring new fields. When
        I'm not coding, you can find me drawing and painting, or listening to
        music.
      </p>
      <p className="text mg-b--sm">
        I'm excited to share my journey and projects with you. Let's create
        something amazing together!
